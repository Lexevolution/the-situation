## F.A.Q.
### Why isn't Neos being updated?
Neos has not had any feature updates since November 2021 due to disagreements that Karel Hulec, the CEO of Solirax (the company behind Neos), and the rest of the Neos team, led by Frooxius (Tomáš Mariančík), had with the direction of Neos, and the roles that each member had. This led the Neos team to stop working on Neos until these disagreements were resolved.

### I heard there's a split?
After some public escalations with the situaiton, the Neos team decided that they no longer wanted to work with Karel.

### When will updates resume?
No-one knows.

### I heard there's something going on with a "new Neos" or "Resonite"?
For more info on that, please see [Resonite.md](./Resonite.md).

### What does cryptocurrency have to do with any of this?
NeosVR currently has a cryptocurrency tied to it called "Neos Credits" (NCR). The importance/priority of this cryptocurrency was only one of multiple equal reasons the Neos team disagreed with Karel.
